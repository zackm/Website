My Website

**My personal website, a constant work in progress.**

View the live version [here](http://zackmayeda.com)

It is based on the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) responsive grid system and uses an extended icon set from [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). I also used [animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) for the home button animation. Many elements are taken from the [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) blog.
